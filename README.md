### Novelty Detections of Foreign Objects and Other Defectives in Food Products using X-Ray Imaging

Representative code from my Master Thesis are accessible. No raw or preprocessed images are available, but snippets can be seen in some of the Jupyter Notebooks. Hence, it is not possible for the viewer to reproduce results. 

## What type of Novelty Detection is employed? 

Novelty detection based on training either a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network or convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) network using only "normal" samples. Subsquently, computing statistical probability distributions based upon an *anomaly score*, an optimal threshold can then be automated by utilizing the G-mean.
